Hi Sean,

 

Attached is our current loss history to date from Copperpoint on WC.  Can you please review for areas that may need some safety improvements with regard to frequency of a particular area or body part?  Seems like there are a lot of strains and many focused on the lower back.  Doing an in-person robust training maybe with proper lifting technics could be helpful??  Will leave it to you to review and develop ðŸ˜Š

 

Thank you,

 

Kim
